## Full Description

### 🤖 What is SkynetPi?

SkynetPi transforms a Raspberry Pi into an AI-powered agent that controls devices **the way humans do** — through the screen, keyboard, and mouse.

**No installation on the target device. No admin access needed. Just plug in and go.**

---

### 🎯 The Problem It Solves

Traditional automation requires:
- ❌ Installing software on target machines
- ❌ Admin/root access
- ❌ API integrations
- ❌ Dealing with security policies

**SkynetPi bypasses all of this** by using the same interface humans use: HDMI output + USB input.

---

### ⚡ How It Works

```
Your Pi          Cables           Target Device
   🤖  ──────────────────────────▶  💻
        HDMI (sees screen)
        USB (controls input)
```

1. **See** — HDMI capture reads the screen
2. **Think** — Claude AI analyzes and decides
3. **Act** — USB HID controls keyboard/mouse
4. **Repeat** — Visual feedback loop until done
